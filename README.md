# How to setup your own (content-based) recommenation system

Simple Recommender is a hosted API that allows you to integrate your own recommender system without any server-side coding. The setup is very straightforward: you only need to send HTTP calls to our API to train your model and to receive recommendations. The API can be accessed using any language, thus either from your website or app (`Angular`, `React`, `Javascript`...) or your server (`NodeJS`, `Curl`, `Java`, `Python`, `Objective-C`, `Ruby`, `.NET`...).

Our objective is to make it as simple as possible to implement a recommender system. In this way, you can focus on the aspects that make your project stand out, instead of writing generic repetitive code.

Please refer to [https://www.abracadabra-recommender.com/docs/](the official docs) for a full overview.
